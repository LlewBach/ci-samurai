### Strategy

[Back to top](#milestone-2-project---code-eye-samurai)

The idea for this game was inspired by the rad Netflix show, 'Blue Eye Samurai' and also a deep empathy for my fellow coders battling with bugs on a daily basis. I decided that a game that offered coders sweet payback time in the form of a virtual rampage would be both of psychological benefit to the user, and of societal service by reducing the probability of a real one.

Creator's goals...
- wants to demonstrate skill with JavaScript
- wants to offer a safe means of decompressing to bug-beleaguered coders

Player's goals...
- wants to enjoy a game
- wants to decompress, and re-energize debugging mojo

Target audience...
- employers who will be considering the creator's skill and employability
- seething coders who need their problems to just 'bug-ger off'

Unique selling proposition
- XXXXXXXXXXXXXX

### Scope

[Back to top](#milestone-2-project---code-eye-samurai)

1) What the customer says they need - a fun game
2) What the customer actually needs - a morale boost for debugging
3) What the customer doesn't know they need - an urgent psychological decompression
